## Deployment Guidelines

### Staging Deployment 
This project leverages GitHub Actions to automate deployments to your staging server. Any code pushed to the `main` branch will automatically trigger the deployment process. 

Checkout the workflow for your deployment status - [Staging Deployment Workflow](https://github.com/ColoredCow/goonj/actions/workflows/staging-deployment.yml)
