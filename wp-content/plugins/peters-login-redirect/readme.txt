Redirect users to different locations after they log in, log out and register based on different conditions.

== Description ==

[LoginWP](https://loginwp.com/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=liteversion) (formerly Peter's Login Redirect) lets you define a set of redirect rules for specific users, users with specific roles, users with specific capabilities, and a blanket rule for all other users. Also, set a redirect URL for post-registration.

You can use the following placeholders in your URLs so that the system will build a dynamic URL upon each login: **{{username}}**, **{{user_slug}}**, **{{website_url}}**.

Upgrade to [LoginWP PRO](https://loginwp.com/pricing/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=liteversion) to redirect users to the current page they are logging in from or back to the previous (or referrer) page after login using **{{current_page}}** and **{{previous_page}}** placeholders. [Learn more](https://loginwp.com/wordpress-redirect-referrer-page-after-login/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=liteversion)

You can add your own code logic before and between any of the plugin's normal redirect checks if needed. [See our documentation](https://loginwp.com/docs/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=liteversion). Some examples include: redirecting the user based on their IP address and redirecting users to a special page on the first login.

Please visit the [plugin page](https://loginwp.com/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=liteversion) with any questions.

Login redirects not working? This plugin uses WordPress's standard login_redirect hook. The usual cause of problems is that another plugin is using the hook first, or there is a custom login form that isn't even running through the standard WordPress login functions.
